Pydantic is powerful library for data validation. Create a schema, populate it and validate it! 

One common use case for Pydantic is handling data received from an API in a programmatic way. For example, it can be used to load, validate, and serialize JSON payloads. In Python, dictionaries are often untyped, which limits IDE support for developers. Pydantic ensures that data conforms to the expected format, allowing you to work with it as you would with any other structured object. In addition to accessing model fields directly like object attributes, Pydantic models can be easily converted, serialized (or "dumped"), and used just like any standard Python object.

Pydantic integrates seamlessly with JSON Schema, allowing models to be [exported as JSON Schema](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/concepts/json_schema/) files. Additionally, using tools like [datamodel-code-generator](https://github.com/koxudaxi/datamodel-code-generator), Pydantic models can be generated from JSON Schema and other formats.
