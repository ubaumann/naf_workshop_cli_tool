Just as [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) is a Python web framework for building APIs with type hints, [Typer](https://typer.tiangolo.com/) serves a similar purpose for creating Python CLI tools. Both frameworks are developed by [Sebastián Ramírez](https://github.com/tiangolo) and share a similar design philosophy. Typer is built on top of Click, so you can also access all the features of Click when needed.

Since version [0.6.0](https://typer.tiangolo.com/release-notes/?h=rich#060), Typer has deep integration with Rich.
