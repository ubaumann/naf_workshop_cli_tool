Poetry is a popular Python package manager widely used in the Python community. However, in recent times, `uv` is gaining increasing attention. Poetry offers several advantages over traditional methods like `pip`, `requirements.txt`, and `setup.py`. With Poetry, project dependencies are clearly defined in the `pyproject.toml` file, and the exact versions of installed packages are locked in the `poetry.lock` file, ensuring consistent environments across different setups.
