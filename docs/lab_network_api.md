Using Nornir and the plugins to interact with the device APIs.
If you'd like to work with your own lab setup, feel free to do so. This lab uses a mocked NAPALM driver to minimize resource usage and ensure it runs on any notebook. If you prefer to use NETCONF, you can use the [pytest-netconf](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-netconf/)plugin to help with mocking.
